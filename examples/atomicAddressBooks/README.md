Encode contacts
===============

Do many add contacts in just one vote. Useful for batching new dao member in the same time as giving them first tokens.

## Usage
1. Change `assignations.json` data. Set up the DAO, voting and token manager
apps, and the list of assignations you want do.
2. Execute `node index.js | sh` to run the command.
3. On successful, open your DAO and see the new vote.
